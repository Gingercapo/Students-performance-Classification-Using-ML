# Students-performance-Classification-Using-ML
Compare the performance of Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch implementations in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix and make recommendations with respect to their strengths and weakness

Step-by-Step Workflow:
1. Load and Prepare Data
load the dataset.
View the dataset count the size and clear the data set.

2. Scikit-learn Implementation
Implement DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn to classify students' performance.
Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and other metrics using Scikit-learn's metrics module.
Visualize evaluation metrics.

3. TensorFlow Implementation
Create a neural network model in TensorFlow to emulate a decision tree structure.
Train the model to classify students' performance.
Evaluate and visualize performance metrics.

4. PyTorch Implementation
Develop a neural network in PyTorch to mimic a decision tree.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Visualize the metrics for comparison.

5. Comparison and Recommendation
Compare the performance of the models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Analyze strengths and weaknesses of each implementation.
Recommend the best model based on performance, precision, and accuracy.
